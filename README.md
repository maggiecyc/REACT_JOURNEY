#### 'Use Client Side'
In Next.js, the “use client” functionality defines a component as a client-side rendering entity. 
Here’s what it does:
Client Components: For requiring dynamic updates and real-time interactions. They render directly in the user’s browser, offering responsive interfaces without full-page reloads. Ideal for interactive elements like live forms, chat features, and dynamic widgets.
How to Use It:
To declare a component as a client-side rendering entity, add the “use client” directive at the top of a file (before any imports).
By defining “use client”, you specify that the component’s rendering operations should occur on the client-side, leveraging features like useState, useEffect, and browser APIs (e.g., geolocation or localStorage).
Boundary Definition:
The directive creates a boundary between Server Components (rendered on the server) and Client Components (rendered in the browser).
Once you define this boundary, all child components and modules imported into it are considered part of the client bundle.
Here’s an example using TypeScript:
// app/counter.tsx
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}

Remember, “use client” optimizes client-side rendering performance for designated components, allowing dynamic updates without full-page reloads. 🚀1
